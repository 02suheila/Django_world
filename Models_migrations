>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  MIGRATIONS  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>-
->Migration is a folder in app
->intially there is no data in migration
->when we hit(change) some command then migration files are created
INSTALL SQLITE 
step-1:open database -no table and data is created
step-2:run command as py manage.py makemigrations
it shows model in command prompt
as:create model student(model_name)
step-3:open file 0001_initial.py-it has data 2 fields as dependence and operation
where, dependence contains migrate file
where,operation contains files of model
step-4: if we make change in model data ,it gives 0002-initial.py .where we update our data
python manage.py makemigrations
step-5:if we make another change ,it gives another updated file
***********if we delete any migration file it shows data corrupts in database.********************
OBBSERVATION: at last of database we found our migrations which we updated
